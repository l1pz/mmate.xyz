# Tasks

Pick the first unchecked task. One task per session. Log a 2-line handoff at the bottom.

## Phase 0: Foundation
- [x] Vite, AGENTS/ARCHITECTURE/TASKS docs
- [x] TypeScript, Biome, Vitest, `npm run check`, build guard test
- [x] `public/` assets, multi-page `vite.config.js`, CSS color variables
- [x] Card engine rewritten: no duplicate methods, escaped HTML, bounds errors, tests
- [x] Review and approve the "feature modules" plan in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] Add GitHub Actions CI running `npm run check`; decide hosting and add deploy
- [x] Fill in real contact info (phone placeholder) and make the `<noscript>` fallback match the JS cards (consider generating it at build time)
- [x] Tiny: bring back the fake phone line `phone: +36 xx xxx xxxx` (the +36 shows Hungary; never a real number) in the JS contact card and the `<noscript>` copy. Keep it the same in both and keep the card at 32 rows x 41 cols (remove the 2 extra blank rows added before the binary footer)

## Phase 1: Engine polish
- [x] Border styles + toggle (retro, ascii, single, double, rounded; default none)
- [x] Pick a font with full box-drawing coverage (DejaVu Sans Mono) and fix the `/fonts/stylesheet.css` 404 (fonts moved to `public/fonts/`)
- [ ] Binary footer decode animation on hover/click
- [ ] JGS font toggle next to Space Mono

## Phase 2: Blog
- [ ] Markdown loader + frontmatter (title, date, tags, slug)
- [ ] Blog card on home grid
- [ ] TUI reading view with progress meter
- [ ] RSS feed script

## Phase 3: Tools
- [ ] Binary / Base64 / Hex / ROT13 playground
- [ ] Image to ASCII / dither studio
- [ ] Fluid dynamics experiment (currently an empty stub)
- [ ] Scratchpad + JSON formatter

## Phase 4: Gallery
- [ ] Gallery card, dither/ASCII <-> raw photo view, albums

## Phase 5: Polish
- [ ] "Oracle": a small model thinking out loud 24/7, streamed to a card. One generator on the server (llama.cpp, in-process via llama-cpp-python, FastAPI, SSE broadcast, ring buffer so new visitors see text at once, connection cap, heartbeat), no visitor input. Output must be coherent: test candidate models (SmolLM2-360M, Llama 3.2 1B, Qwen2.5 1.5B, Gemma 3 1B) before choosing; RAM budget ~1.5 GB, low CPU (nice 19, throttled tokens, optional pause when nobody watches), Docker mem/cpu limits, Traefik, canned-line fallback in the card
- [ ] CRT scanline/glow toggle
- [ ] Optional key-click sounds

## Handoff log
### Session 1 (2026-10-02)
- Done: Phase 0 foundation above (branch `chore/foundation`). `npm run check` passes.
- Next: user reviews the feature-module plan; then CI/hosting.

### Session 2 (2026-10-02)
- Done: user approved the feature-module plan; recorded in DECISIONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md marked approved.
- Done: CI + deploy live. Merging to `main` rsyncs `dist/` to the netcup server (nginx container behind Traefik, `https://1000110.xyz`) as a restricted `deploy` user; see DECISIONS.md. Site renamed to 1000110.xyz.
- Next: contact card done (see Session 3); then Phase 1.

### Session 3 (2026-10-02)
- Done: phone removed (user won't share it), email is mmateka89@gmail.com in JS card and noscript; repo renamed to l1pz/1000110.xyz; `.gitattributes` forces LF (CRLF checkouts broke Biome on Windows). Noscript is still hand-written: generating it at build time stays an open idea.
- Next: Phase 1, "Decide: bring back ASCII borders on cards?" (needs a user decision).

### Session 3b (2026-10-02)
- Done: fake `phone: +36 xx xxx xxxx` restored in JS card and noscript; the 2 extra blank rows removed; `npm run check` passes. Not yet eyeballed in `npm run dev`.
- Next: Phase 1, "Decide: bring back ASCII borders on cards?" (needs a user decision).

### Session 4 (2026-10-02)
- Done: optional border styles (`src/borders.ts`), setting + toggle (`src/settings.ts`, key `b` + footer button), home cards moved to `src/cards.ts`, tests for all of it; noscript cards now unframed.
- Next: font task above (user decides which font); check the unicode border styles in `npm run dev` first.
- Also done (same PR): DejaVu Sans Mono replaces Space Mono (fixes the unicode border styles); `fonts/` moved to `public/fonts/` (was 404 in production); cards get a gap when a border is on. Checked `double` and `rounded` in Chrome.
