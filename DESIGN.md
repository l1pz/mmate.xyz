# Design system: 1000110.xyz

STATUS: IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-10 (shell PR #14, consistency PR). This is the source of truth for how every page looks and behaves. Code: `src/core/` (site map, frame, status line, keys), `styles/shell.css`, `styles/theme.css`.

Every page is a terminal session. Pages share one frame and serve their own content inside it. Phones come first: most visitors arrive on one.

## 1. The grid unit: the character cell
- One font (DejaVu Sans Mono), one size, one character cell. Widths are in `ch`, heights in lines. Hierarchy comes from color and markers (`#`, `$`), never from font size or weight.
- A phone shows about 40 columns (375px / 8.4px). **40 columns is the design width.** Desktop adds space around it, never a different layout language.
- The reading column is `min(72ch, 100%)` with a 1.5ch gutter.
- Small phones: the font size shrinks below ~400px wide so 44 columns (41 of content plus gutters) always fit. Only code boxes and wide art may scroll sideways.

## 2. Tokens (all in `styles/theme.css`, never raw hex elsewhere)
| Role | Variable | Used for |
|------|----------|----------|
| text | `--fg` | body text |
| secondary | `--gray` | dim text, borders, secrets, crumbs, dates, the `$` of a prompt |
| accent / title | `--yellow` | page titles, headings, the current window, prompt commands |
| structure | `--aqua` | links, h2, art accents |
| prompt / ok | `--green` | prompt lines, h3 |
| visited | `--purple` | visited links, art accent |
| error | `--red` | errors |
| surface | `--bg`, `--bg-soft` | page background, the status line and inline code |

Spacing: prose and listings use a 1.6 line height; ASCII art uses 1.0 (tight, so it holds its shape). Blocks are separated by one blank line.

## 3. The frame (every page, no exceptions)
`renderPage({ page, command, body, date, ... })` in `src/core/shell.ts` outputs, in this fixed order:
1. **Crumbs**: `1000110.xyz / blog / hello-world`, gray, each part but the last a link.
2. **Man header**: `NAME(1)    section    date`, one dashed rule under it. The date is the page's own (a post's date) or today.
3. **Prompt line**: `$ command`, the `$` dim, the command in yellow-green. Every block of content is the output of a command.
4. **Body**: the page's own content (it may contain more prompt lines).
5. **Secret** (optional): a hidden dim binary message.
6. **End prompt**: `$ █` with the blinking cursor (static under reduced motion).

Page code only writes the body. The pages are listed once in `src/core/site.ts`; adding a page means one entry there plus its HTML file in `vite.config.js` (a test fails if they disagree).

## 4. The status line (every page)
Fixed at the bottom, same on every page:
- Left: the site windows from the site map, `1:home 2:blog 3:exp`, as links. The current page is highlighted yellow with `*`; a child page keeps its parent's window. This is the navigation on phones.
- Right: a clock and the scroll progress, `23:41 [████░░░░] 42%`. Under 600px the clock hides, under 500px the bar hides, so a phone shows `42%`.
- It clears the iPhone home indicator (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`), and on touch screens each window is at least 44px tall.

## 5. Keys (every page; only a bonus, everything works by tap)
`1`-`9` go to site window N, `j`/`k` scroll, `g`/`G` top and bottom, `b` or Esc go up one level (a blog post goes back to the list, otherwise the parent page or home). Space, PageUp, PageDown and the arrows scroll natively.

## 6. Content patterns (what a page puts in the body)
| pattern | pages | looks like |
|---------|-------|------------|
| session | home | one command per section: `$ whoami`, `$ cat portrait.txt`, `$ ls ~/blog`, ... with ASCII art in tight blocks |
| listing | blog index, experiments, the lists on the home page | rows of one link each (`ls -l` style); the row is the tap target (44px on touch) |
| prose | a blog post | left-aligned column, headings with a dim `#` marker, boxed code, dimmed quotes |
| tool | an experiment | the frame, with the canvas or form as the body |
| later | gallery, oracle | gallery: listing of albums, a post-like viewer; oracle: a feed inside the frame |
Cards (the fixed 41 x 32 character tile, `src/card.ts`) are not a page pattern. The engine stays as a toolkit for future widgets.

## 7. Hidden messages (easter eggs)
Dim binary text, 4 bytes (35 columns) per line, `aria-hidden`, no hint that it is there, no decode, no animation. A page may have one in the frame's `secret` slot (a blog post sets `secret:` in its frontmatter, at most 32 characters); the home page has one under the portrait, projects and contact sections.

## 8. Phone rules (apply to every pattern)
- One column, no page-level horizontal scroll (code boxes and wide art may scroll inside their own block).
- Tap targets at least 44px tall on touch screens (`pointer: coarse`): status line windows, crumbs, listing rows.
- No feature may need hover or a keyboard.
- No motion beyond the cursor blink; honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Check every UI change at 360px and 390px wide, not only on desktop.

## 9. How to add a page
1. Add an entry to `pages` in `src/core/site.ts` (child pages set `parent` and get no window).
2. Create the HTML file (copy `experiments/index.html`: `body class="shell"`, a `<main class="page">`, `<footer id="status">`, a `<noscript>` note, `viewport-fit=cover`) and list it in `vite.config.js`.
3. Build the body and call `renderPage` (or `mountPage` for a single block); then `bootPage`.
4. Test the renderer with `assertShell`. `npm run check` fails if a step is missing.

## 10. History and rejected ideas
- The home page used to be a grid of 41 x 32 cards. Beside the blog it felt like a different site (centered text, equal tiles, no prompt), so it became a session; the card engine, its colors and its tests stayed.
- The man header date: a page's own date where it has one, today otherwise (decided 2026-10-10). A blinking clock colon was declined.
- Still open: do the stacked sections of the home page feel too long on a phone? Should art and listings go two columns on very wide screens?
